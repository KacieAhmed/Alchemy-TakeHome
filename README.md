### Gas fees

When learning blockchain development, you may have noticed that transactions made on the Ethereum network cost a fee. These fees are called *transaction fees*, and they are a fundamental concept in web3.

The purpose of transaction fees on the Ethereum network is to enable security and decentralization. By requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network, malicous users are prevented from spamming the network. Thus, cyber attacks that are difficult to defend against in web2 aren't even fesible to execute on the Ethereum network. A great example of this is how transaction fees and gas limits make it financially infeasible to execute a denial of service (DDOS) on Ethereum. 

Without transaction fees, vital consensus protcols like Proof of Work would also not work. Ethereum miners would not get paid, and several other important functions in the Ethereum network would fail. **But how are these fees calculated? Let's explore.**



## The London Upgrade (EIP-1559)

Before the London upgrade on August 5th, 2021, gas fees were calculated with the formula **gas fees = gas spent * gas price**. 

**Gas spent** is the total amount of gas required for a transaction, and **gas price** is the total amount of ether you are willing to pay per gas unit of execution. 

This formula is very simple. If your transaction cost 30,000 units of gas, and your gas price is 200 [Gwei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp#:~:text=Gwei%20is%20a%20denomination%20of,interference%20from%20a%20third%20party.), then by the Pre-London upgrade formula (gas fee = 30,000 gas * 200 gwei) you will pay 6000000 Gwei or 0.006 ETH.
