### Gas fees

When learning blockchain development, you may have noticed that transactions made on the Ethereum network cost a fee. These fees are called *transaction fees*, and they are a fundamental concept in web3.

The purpose of transaction fees on the Ethereum network is to enable security and decentralization. By requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network, malicous users are prevented from spamming the network. Thus, cyber attacks that are difficult to defend against in web2 aren't even fesible to execute on the Ethereum network. A great example of this is how transaction fees and gas limits make it financially infeasible to execute a denial of service (DDOS) on Ethereum. 

Without transaction fees, vital consensus protcols like Proof of Work would also not work. Ethereum miners would not get paid, and several other important functions in the Ethereum network would fail. **But how are these fees calculated? Let's explore.**
